# Introduction

For this final project, I will be working alone. I am going to analyze a dataset that holds data for the Real-Estate industry as reported by Zestimate. Zestimate was created to give consumers as much information as possible about homes and the housing market, marking the first time consumers had access to this type of home value information at no cost

# Data Source

Datasets are available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data File descriptions

properties_2016.csv - all the properties_2017 with their home features for 2016.
properties_2017.csv - all the properties_2017 with their home features for 2017
train_2016.csv - the training set with transactions from 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2016
train_2017.csv - the training set with transactions from 1/1/2017 to 9/15/2017
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
zillow_data_dictionary.xlsx - definition of data fields

# Project Goal
I seek to establish an understanding of the relationship between home prices and characteristcs of housing as described in Zestimateâ€™s datasets. I will draw a relation to factors such as economic forces, home features, and geographical inequality; and their impact on prices of homes.

I will exhaustively apply the various concepts that I have learnt this far, to come up with a good analysis report of this dataset.

# Loading Libraries


```{r}

## Reading the csv file
```{r}
properties_2017 <-  read.csv(file="C:\\Users\\tenzi\\OneDrive\\Documents\\Data607\\Final Project\\properties_2017.csv", row.names = NULL)
str(properties_2017)
```
# DATA TRANSFORMATION
# Missing Data

```{r}
prop_miss <- function(x){
  sum(is.na(x)) / length(x)*100
}

missing.bycol <- apply(properties_2017,2,prop_miss)
missing.byrow <-  apply(properties_2017,1,prop_miss)

missdata.df <- as.data.frame(missing.bycol)
setDT(missdata.df, keep.rownames = TRUE)
names(missdata.df) <- c('Col_Names', 'pct_missing')

plt1<-ggplot(data = missdata.df , aes(x= reorder(Col_Names, pct_missing), y=pct_missing)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity",aes(fill = pct_missing), position = position_stack(reverse= TRUE)) + coord_flip()
plt1
```
# Columns with more than 20% missing value
```{r}
missdata.df20 <- missdata.df %>% filter (pct_missing>=20) 
plt2<-ggplot(data = missdata.df20  , aes(x= reorder(Col_Names, pct_missing), y=pct_missing)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity",aes(fill = pct_missing), position = position_stack(reverse= TRUE)) + coord_flip()
plt2
```
Using the 80% rule, missing values in more than 20% of samples may be removed from the dataset.
```{r}
missing_prop <- sapply(properties_2017, function(x) sum(is.na(x))/length(x))
variables_to_remove <- names(missing_prop)[missing_prop > 1 - 0.8]
variables_to_remove 
```
```{r}
# The dataset afterwards
df_transformed <- properties_2017[, !colnames(properties_2017) %in% variables_to_remove]
dim(df_transformed)
```
```{r}
str(df_transformed)
```
The dataset now has 29 variables, which I will use for the rest of my analysis.
